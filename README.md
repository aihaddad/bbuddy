# BiteBuddy

I started learning Rails late in 2013. The intention was use it to build SaaS apps for a few startup ideas I had at the time. This is the last of those ideas, and it came after a Startup Weekend event in 2015. I also tried to make it into a learning project that combines Material Design, Angular 1.x and Gulp on the frontend/workflow, with a Rails API on the backend.

The project is dead, but the app is still hosted on Heroku @ http://bbuddy.herokuapp.com
